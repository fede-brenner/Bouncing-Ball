# Balls
There's a menu with an animated background and title.
The menu has 2 options: Bouncing Balls and Pool of Balls.

## Bouncing-Ball
By clicking you can add a certain amount of balls, at a certain speed and at a specific size, that bounce at the borders of the window.
The ball color is randomized.

There's a configuration button to open the configuration menu.
You can toggle gravity on and off at the configuration menu. When its activated you can edit the gravity intesity and bounciness of the balls.
